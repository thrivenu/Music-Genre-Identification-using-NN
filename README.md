#We have used ANN Classifier to classify the music into various genres such as :

                                             1.Blues
                                             2.Classical
                                             3.Country
                                             4.Disco
                                             5.Hiphop
                                             6.Jazz
                                             7.Reggae
                                             8.Rock
                                             9.Metal and
                                             10.Pop
The Datset used for this project is GITZAN dataset. This dataset was used for the well-known paper in genre classification “ Musical genre classification of audio signals “ by G. Tzanetakis and P. Cook in IEEE Transactions on Audio and Speech Processing 2002. The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. Each genre consists of 100 sound clips.

We have also used Keras API to train a ANN Classifier. A module named Librosa was used for music analysis.Librosa is a Python library that analyzes music and audio. Librosa is primarily used when working with audio data, such as in music creation (using LSTMs) and automatic speech recognition. It gives you the tools you'll need to build music information retrieval systems. Librosa aids in the visualization and feature extraction of audio signals using various signal processing techniques.
